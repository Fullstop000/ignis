## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- `Session` core model wrapping a stateless `Agent`, exposing `prompt()` and `compact()`.
- Context compaction: token-budget range, auto-trigger threshold, 9-section summary prompt; `/compact` command and `[compaction]` config.

### Changed
- Renamed `repl` → `console`; `agent`/`session`/`cli`/`console` are now directory modules.
- TUI: frame-capped coalesced rendering, borderless Claude Code-style layout, status footer (dir · model · ctx%), loading status above input, mouse-wheel scroll, Ctrl/Cmd+J newline.
- Merged `/new` into `/clear` (single session-reset command).

### Fixed
- Multi-byte (CJK) input no longer panics; cursor stays on UTF-8 char boundaries and uses display-width columns.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Switchable `web_search` backend with Brave and Tavily providers, selected via
  `[web_search]` in `config.toml` (`provider` + `api_key`).
- `docs/web-search.md` tutorial for configuring and using web search.
- Project documentation: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this changelog, and an
  Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`.
- CI workflow (`fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` + tests on Linux/macOS) and a
  cross-platform release workflow triggered by `v*` tags.
- `config.example.toml` template.
- `/ship` skill (`.claude/skills/ship/`) — the release runbook for this repo.

### Changed
- Configuration format migrated from YAML to TOML; config is loaded from
  `~/.ignis/config.toml`.

### Removed
- Dead DuckDuckGo HTML-scraping implementation of `web_search` (it had stopped
  returning results due to anti-bot challenges).

### Security
- Removed a real API key that was present in a local (unpushed) commit and
  git-ignored local config files so secrets can no longer be committed.
